## Problem Statement  
In multivariate data analysis, understanding how variables depend on each other is often as important as studying their individual behaviors. Traditional correlation measures, such as Pearson’s correlation, assume linearity and symmetry and thus fail to capture extreme co-movements or nonlinear dependencies that frequently arise in real-world systems.  

In financial contexts, for example, asset returns may appear weakly correlated during stable periods but exhibit strong dependence during downturns; a phenomenon known as *tail dependence*. Standard Gaussian models underestimate the joint probability of extreme losses because they assume constant, symmetric dependence. This leads to a serious underestimation of systemic risk and joint failures.  

Copula-based modeling provides a flexible solution to this problem by separating the marginal behavior of individual variables from their dependence structure. This allows accurate modeling of nonlinear, asymmetric, and tail-dependent relationships essential in finance, insurance, healthcare, and environmental science.

## Objective  
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how **copula models** can effectively capture complex, nonlinear dependencies among multiple variables. By decomposing multivariate distributions into their marginal and dependence components, copulas allow to analyze, simulate, and quantify joint behaviors under extreme conditions; far beyond the capabilities of linear correlation-based approaches.  

This project outlines the theoretical foundation, computational implementation, and interpretive framework for copula-based dependence modeling. It provides a reproducible, extensible workflow for high-dimensional dependence analysis in domains where joint risk or interaction among variables is critical.

## Methodology  
A detailed mathematical and statistical explanation of this approach, including model formulation, marginal fitting, dependence estimation, parameter inference, and validation, is available in the accompanying document: **[Methodology: Copula-Based Modeling of Multivariate Dependence](https://github.com/ShahnewazMorshed/Gaussian-Copula/blob/main/Copula-Based%20Modeling%20of%20Multivariate%20Dependence.pdf)**.

### Python Notebooks  
This Python notebook demonstrates how to construct custom joint probability distributions using Gaussian copulas. It walks through the process of simulating correlated multivariate Gaussian samples, transforming them into uniform variables via the Gaussian CDF, and then mapping these uniforms into arbitrary target distributions using their inverse CDFs. Visualizations are provided to illustrate how dependence is preserved across transformations and how uniform variables are reshaped into normal, Beta, or other desired forms, enabling flexible multivariate modeling with controlled correlation structures.
